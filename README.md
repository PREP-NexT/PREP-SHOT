## Overview

**PREP-SHOT** (**P**athways for **R**enewable **E**nergy **P**lanning coupling **S**hort-term **H**ydropower **O**pera**T**ion) is a transparent, modular, and open-source energy expansion model, offering advanced solutions for multi-scale, intertemporal, and cost-effective expansion of energy systems and transmission lines. It's developed by [Zhanwei Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhanwei-Liu-4) and [Xiaogang He](http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~hexg/) from the [PREP-NexT](https://github.com/PREP-NexT) Lab at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/).

## Why the Name?

The clean energy transition is our new moonshot to combat climate change ‚Äì an ambitious 'shot' yet achievable. We're up to the challenge, which is why we developed PREP-SHOT to prepare us for this long shot.

## Key Features

- Optimization model based on linear programming for multi-zone energy systems.
- Cost minimization while meeting given demand time series.
- Adjustable operation on hourly-spaced time steps.
- Input data in Excel format and output data in ``NetCDF`` format using [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/).
- Support for multiple solvers like [HiGHS](https://github.com/jump-dev/HiGHS.jl) , [GUROBI](https://www.gurobi.com/), [COPT](https://www.copt.de/), and [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/) via [PyOptInterface](https://github.com/metab0t/PyOptInterface).
- Allows input of multiple scenarios for specific parameters.
- A pure Python program, leveraging [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/) for simplified complex data analysis and extensibility.

## Getting Started

This section includes a brief tutorial on running your first PREP-SHOT model.

1. Clone the repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PREP-NexT/PREP-SHOT.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies

    ```bash
    cd PREP-SHOT
    conda create -n prep-shot python=3.8
    conda activate prep-shot
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run your first model

    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

This example is inspired by real-world data. For a detailed elaboration of this tutorial, check out the [Tutorial Page](https://prep-next.github.io/PREP-SHOT/Tutorial.html) in our documentation.

By default, PREP-SHOT uses open-source [HiGHS](https://github.com/jump-dev/HiGHS.jl) solver. Solver-specific parameters are specified in the ``config.json`` file, which should be located in the current working directory. Additionaly, we provide the option to use one of the following three commercial solvers:

+ [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/)
+ [COPT](https://www.copt.de/)
+ [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/)

## Disclaimer

The PREP-SHOT model is an academic project and is not intended to be used as a precise prediction tool for specific hydropower operations or energy planning. The developers will not be held liable for any decisions made based on the use of this model. We recommend applying it in conjunction with expert judgment and other modeling tools in a decision-making context.
